# Wonderful Weather App

## Purpose/Description

This application was created to display the current weather (including temperature, wind speed, humidity, and UV index) in a given city, plus a five-day forecast for the same city. Searched cities are stored in a list on the left of the user's screen, so that the user can return to and view the weather for that city again later. Useful for travelers, or anyone who is curious about the weather.
